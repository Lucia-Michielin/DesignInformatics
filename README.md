Welcome to the Design Informatics Repo.

## Content of the Repository
 Here you can find the slides of my presentation and a short demo you can play around with (to create a gif of the sentiment evolution throughout Jane Austen's books).

### How to use the demo

If you want to just visualise the code you can go to **[This Link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Lucia-Michielin/DesignInformatics/blob/main/DI_Demo/DI_Demo.html)**

If you want to play around with the code the easiest way to do so is via Noteable 

1. Go to https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login
2. Login with your EASE credentials
3. Select RStudio as a personal notebook server and press start
4. Go to File >New Project>Version Control>Git
5. Copy and Paste this repository URL [https://github.com/DCS-training/ScottishAccounts](https://github.com/DCS-training/ScottishAccounts/) as the Repository URL
6. The Project directory name will filled in automatically but you can change it if you want your folder in Notable to have a different name
7. Decide where to locate the folder. By default, it will locate it in your home directory 
8. Press Create Project

Congratulations you have now pulled the content of the repository on your Notable server space the last thing you need to do is to install the packages not already installed in Noteable.
